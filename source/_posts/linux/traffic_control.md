excerpt: 最近测试人员提了一个弱网环境的测试需求，本文描述了使用tc命令实现的流量控制的脚本，模拟弱网环境
---
> `tc`命令的使用细节，可以参考脚本后面的内容，这些内容提取自`tc`命令的说明手册，侧重于从整体上说明`tc`命令的用法和脚本中所涉及的`qdisc`, `class`和`filter`的概念/描述；若要深入理解，可参考[tc-iproute2帮助手册](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/iproute2/tc.8.en.html "帮助手册地址")。

## 脚本使用
可以通过`--help`, `-h`参数来获取脚本帮助:
```
tao@S20:~/tao$ sudo sh test.sh -h
---------test.sh usage:-------------
this script support follow paramters:
  --addr/-a: the ip address, separate by ','
  --clean/-c: boolean, remove the traffic control setting
  --devices/-d: the network interfaces, separate by ','
  --delay/-e: int, the packet delay, default 900, (900ms)
  --loss/-l: int, the packet loss, default 50, (50%)
  --rate/-r: int, the traffic rate, default 100, (100kbps)
-------------------------------------------
tao@S20:~/tao$ 
```
这个流量控制脚本可以设置指定网卡(指定IP)的速率、延迟和丢包率。在进行流量控制之前，`ping`和`curl`命令的输出如下：
```
tao@S20:~/tao$ ping baidu.com

```
上面的`ping`延迟26ms，没有丢包；`curl`命令下载速度为：111MB/s
现在运行脚本来对指定网卡 enp99s0 的流量进行限制：速率为300KB/s, 延迟为：200ms, 丢包率为：20%
```
tao@S20:~/tao$ sudo sh test.sh --devices enp99s0 --delay 200 --rate 300 --loss 20
[INFO] >>> devices: 'enp99s0'
[INFO] >>> delay: '200ms'
[INFO] >>> loss: '20%'
[INFO] >>> rate: '300kbps'
[INFO] >>> addr: 'all'
[INFO] >>> Executing: traffic_control
[INFO] >>> start to configure device 'enp99s0'
[INFO] >>> device 'enp99s0' configure complete
[INFO] >>> all devices are configured and ready for testing
tao@S20:~/tao$ 
```
再次用`ping`和`curl`进行测试，可以看到速率、丢包率和延迟都达到目标:
```
tao@S20:~/tao$ ping baidu.com

## 命令简介
`tc`命令主要是用来查看/操作内核中的traffic control的设置。

## TC DESCRIPTION
Traffic Control由以下概念组成：
- **SHAPING**
    When traffic is shaped, its rate of transmission is under control. Shaping may be more than lowering the available bandwidth - it is also used to smooth out bursts in traffic for better network behaviour. Shaping occurs on egress.
- **SCHEDULING**
    By scheduling the transmission of packets it is possible to improve interactivity for traffic that needs it while still guaranteeing bandwidth to bulk大部分 transfers. Reordering is also called prioritizing, and happens only on egress.
- **POLICING**
    Whereas shaping deals with transmission of traffic, policing pertains to traffic arriving. Policing thus occurs on ingress.
- **DROPPING**
    Traffic exceeding超过 a set bandwidth may also be dropped forthwith, both on ingress and on egress.

Processing of traffic is controlled by three kinds of objects: `qdiscs`, `classes` and `filters`.
- **QDISCS**
    `qdisc` is short for 'queueing discipline' and it is elementary基础,初级 to understanding traffic control. Whenever the kernel needs to send a packet to an interface, it is enqueued to the qdisc configured for that interface. Immediately afterwards, the kernel tries to get as many packets as possible from the qdisc, for giving them to the network adaptor driver.
- **CLASSES**
    Some qdiscs can contain `classes`, which contain further qdiscs - traffic may then be enqueued in any of the inner qdiscs, which are within the classes. When the kernel tries to dequeue a packet from such a `classful qdisc` it can come from any of the classes.A qdisc may for example prioritize certain kinds of traffic by trying to dequeue from certain classes before others.
- **FILTERS**
    A `filter` is used by a classful qdisc to determine in which class a packet will be enqueued. Whenever traffic arrives at a class with subclasses, it needs to be classified. Various methods may be employed to do so, one of these are the filters. All filters attached to the class are called, until one of them returns with a verdict判决. It is important to notice that filters reside within qdiscs - they are not masters of what happens.
    > The available filters are: `basic`, `bpf`, `cgroup`, `route`, `u32`等等，本文用到的是**u32**:
    > `u32`: Generic filtering on arbitrary packet data. The Universal/Ugly 32bit filter allows one to match arbitrary bitfields in the packet. Due to breaking everything down to values, masks and offsets, It is equally powerful and hard to use. Luckily many abstracting directives are present which allow defining rules on a higher level and therefore free the user from having to fiddle不停摆弄 with bits and masks in many cases.

### QEVENTS
Qdiscs may invoke user-configured actions when certain interesting events take place in the qdisc. Each `qevent` can either be unused, or can have a block attached to it. To this block are then attached filters using the "tc block BLOCK_IDX" syntax. The block is executed when the qevent associated with the attachment point takes place.
```bash
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: red limit 500K avpkt 1K \
qevent early_drop block 10
tc filter add block 10 matchall action mirred egress mirror dev eth1
```

### CLASSLESS QDISCS
In the absence of classful qdiscs, classless qdiscs can only be attached at the root of a device. Full syntax:
```
tc qdisc add dev DEV root QDISC_NAME QDISC-PARAMETERS
tc qdisc del dev DEV root
```
The `pfifo_fast` qdisc is the automatic default in the absence of a configured qdisc. The classless qdiscs are: `ingress`, `tbf`,`netem`,`[p|b]fifo`,`red`等等
- **[p|b]fifo**
    Simplest usable qdisc, pure First In, First Out behaviour. Limited in packets or in bytes.
- **ingress**
    This is a special qdisc as it applies to incoming traffic on an interface, allowing for it to be filtered and policed.
- **red**
    Random Early Detection simulates模拟 physical congestion拥塞 by randomly dropping packets when nearing configured bandwidth allocation分配. Well suited to very large bandwidth applications.主要用于出口网络

### CLASSFUL QDISCS
The classful qdiscs are: `HTB`,`PRIO`,`HFSC`等等
`HTB`: The Hierarchy Token Bucket implements a rich linksharing hierarchy of classes with an emphasis on conforming to existing practices.(层次结构令牌桶实现了丰富的类链接共享层次结构，重点是符合现有实践。) HTB facilitates guaranteeing bandwidth to classes, while also allowing specification of upper limits to inter-class sharing. It contains `shaping` elements, based on `TBF` and can prioritize classes.

## THEORY理论 OF OPERATION
Classes form a tree, where each class has a single parent. A class may have multiple children. Some qdiscs allow for runtime addition of classes (HTB) while others (PRIO) are created with a static number of children.
Qdiscs which allow dynamic addition of classes can have zero or more subclasses to which traffic may be enqueued.
Furthermore, each class contains a `leaf qdisc` which by default has `pfifo` behaviour, although another qdisc can be attached in place. This qdisc may again contain classes, but each class can have only one `leaf qdisc`.
When a packet enters a classful qdisc it can be classified to one of the classes within.
Each node within the tree can have its own filters but higher level filters may also point directly to lower classes.
If classification did not succeed, packets are enqueued to the leaf qdisc attached to that class. Check qdisc specific manpages for details, however.

## NAMING
All qdiscs, classes and filters have IDs, which can either be specified or be automatically assigned.
IDs consist of **major** number and a **minor** number, separated by a colon - **major:minor**. Both **major** and **minor** are hexadecimal numbers and are limited to 16 bits. There are two special values: root is signified by **major** and **minor** of all ones, and unspecified is all zeros.
- QDISCS
    A qdisc, which potentially can have children, gets assigned a **major** number, called a 'handle', leaving the **minor** number namespace available for classes. The handle is expressed as '10:'. It is customary to explicitly assign a handle to qdiscs expected to have children.
- CLASSES
    Classes residing under a qdisc share their qdisc **major** number, but each have a separate **minor** number called a 'classid' that has no relation to their parent classes, only to their parent qdisc. The same naming custom as for qdiscs applies.
- FILTERS
    Filters have a three part ID, which is only needed when using a hashed filter hierarchy.

## TC COMMANDS
The following commands are available for qdiscs, classes and filter:
- add
    Add a qdisc, class or filter to a node. For all entities, a **parent** must be passed, either by passing its ID or by attaching directly to the root of a device. When creating a qdisc or a filter, it can be named with the **handle** parameter. A class is named with the **classid** parameter.
- delete
    A qdisc can be deleted by specifying its handle, which may also be 'root'. All subclasses and their leaf qdiscs are automatically deleted, as well as any filters attached to them.
- show
    Displays all filters attached to the given interface. A valid parent ID must be passed.
